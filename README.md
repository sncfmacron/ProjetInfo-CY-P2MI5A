## Prerequisites

- You need **GnuPlot** to obtain graphs and **make** program to compile.
- To install `GnuPlot` on Ubuntu/Debian distributions, use `sudo apt install gnuplot`.
- To install `make` on Ubuntu/Debian distributions, use `sudo apt install make`.

## Usage

To run the program, use `./c-wire.sh <path_file.csv> <station_type> <consumer_type> [central_id]`.

Example : `./c-wire.sh input/DATA_CWIRE.csv hva comp 3`.

Use `-h` parameter to get full help.

- The script `c-wire.sh` allows you to enter options to identify specific stations, checks the integrity of all files and sorts the useful data for station processing. It launches compilation using `make` and produces graphics using `GnuPlot`. It ensures the existence of required directories (`tmp`, `graphs`, `output`) or creates them as needed.

- The script `basics.c` contains all basic function such as security functions. The library `basics.h` contains all the libraries needed to run the program and the structure definitions.

- `input.c` contains functions to get the sorted data from `c-wire.sh`.

- `main.c` is the heart of the program. This script executes all program functions and returns a value to indicate that execution has gone well.

- `output.c` contains functions for creating output files in CSV format.

- `settings.h` contains multiple constants used to guarantee program security and optimization.

- `tree.c` contains functions for AVL tree management.
